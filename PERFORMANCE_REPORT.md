# Performance Benchmarking Report

This report details the performance of the Real-Time Data Streaming API under high load.

## Test Configuration

- Concurrent Users: 1000
- Messages per User: 10
- Total Messages: 10,000

## Results

```
Benchmark completed in [TIME]
Total requests: [TOTAL_REQUESTS]
Successful requests: [SUCCESSFUL_REQUESTS]
Failed requests: [FAILED_REQUESTS]
Requests per second: [RPS]

Latency (ms):
  50%: [LATENCY_50]
  90%: [LATENCY_90]
  95%: [LATENCY_95]
  99%: [LATENCY_99]
```

## Analysis

[Add your analysis here based on the benchmark results. Consider the following points:]

1. Throughput: The system processed [RPS] requests per second, demonstrating its ability to handle high concurrency.
2. Success Rate: [Calculate and comment on the success rate]
3. Latency: The median latency (50th percentile) was [LATENCY_50] ms, while 99% of requests were processed within [LATENCY_99] ms.
4. Scalability: [Comment on how well the system scales with 1000 concurrent users]
5. Areas for Improvement: [Identify any bottlenecks or areas where performance could be enhanced]

## Conclusion

[Summarize the overall performance of the system and whether it meets the requirement of handling 1000+ concurrent streams with low latency]
