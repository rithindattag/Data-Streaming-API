## Analysis

[Add your analysis here based on the benchmark results. Consider the following points:]

1. Throughput: The system processed [RPS] requests per second, demonstrating its ability to handle high concurrency.
2. Success Rate: [Calculate and comment on the success rate]
3. Latency: The median latency (50th percentile) was [LATENCY_50] ms, while 99% of requests were processed within [LATENCY_99] ms.
4. Scalability: [Comment on how well the system scales with 1000 concurrent users]
5. Areas for Improvement: [Identify any bottlenecks or areas where performance could be enhanced]

## Conclusion

[Summarize the overall performance of the system and whether it meets the requirement of handling 1000+ concurrent streams with low latency]
